# Acamatch

Acamatch is an opensource platform to match academics working in similar research fields. Too often than not, researchers in the same organization can have similar issues and never know about it.

## Idea

We were inspired by a story from Aalto University. Three research groups found themselves researching the same technical topic for months and had no idea of each other. After realizing at a conference in Milan that there were other researchers from Aalto University, they finally found each other and realized how much time had been wasted.

No more.

Acamatch matches you with researchers with similar interests, relevant experience, and mutual problems. Save time by standing on the shoulders of giants.
